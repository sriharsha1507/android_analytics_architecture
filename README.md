# Android Analytics Architecture
Analytics are really helpful to the developer. It gives us more insights on users behavior towards the application and also helps you to develop features depending on their behavior
and liking which gives more success to the developer.

This project is useful in defining your analytics layer. I just created this project in a simple manner to explain how I define my rules in creating an analytics layer in my project.
This is also helpful to the people who have multi module project. With the idea I have presented, you need not expose all the events to all modules. Each module can have it's own analytics
layer which takes info from core-analytics layer. So, that it encapsulates info like you needed.

This is pretty flexible.
If your boss asks you to add a different analytics service. It will be super easy for the dev to add one more layer and prototype it to the requested persons. That's the part the dev 
will enjoy this hardwork.


## TODO üî®
üõ†Ô∏è Write Unit tests to show how this implementation won't get coupled with your business logic
